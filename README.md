# Twitter_MVP

A twitter streaming API is designed which takes input as the keyword which the user wants to search and the number of tweets which he/she wants to have in the database.
Both SQL as well as NoSQL implementations have been shown.
The metadata which includes the user id , the number of tweets , date of the tweet , number of followers which the person who has tweeted the tweet etc is stored in the database and later exported as csv file to the local machine for further operations.
